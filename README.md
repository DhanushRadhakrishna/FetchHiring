Hi, I am Dhanush Radhakrishna.
I am currently a Master's student at University of California and I have completed this task with my busy college schedule. 
Thank you for running my app, which I have implemented with the best understanding of the requirement. 
The app has two screens. First one lists all the LisIds. The second can be navigated my clicking on one of the view of the recycler views 
which takes you to the next acreen which displays all the items with their ID, ListID and Name sorted and filtered according to the requirement.
 I have followed the best pracitces of Android app developement, with error handling and clean architecture like how a biggesr app
would be done.
Although, this task could be completed within few hours given the college assignements and completing my requirements for graduation, I have taken a few hours more.
